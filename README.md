An Analysis of Bike Rentals by User Type through Ridge, Lasso, and Group Lasso Penalization Techniques 

Abstract

This project seeks to create a predictive model for the number of hourly bike rentals from a Washington D.C. bikeshare using the Lasso and Ridge Regression. By further dividing the rentals into casual and registered user rentals, we observed differing levels of predictability for the features present in the models. Later, the Group Lasso model was employed to eliminate predetermined groups of multicollinear  variables such as Days of the Week, Months, and Hourly Categorical Descriptions of Weather Conditions.   

Introduction

In urban cities across the world, bike sharing systems have become a popular, cheaper alternative to ride sharing apps and other conventional means of transportation. An individual can rent a bike from multiple different locations across town, and return it to an entirely different location, with no human interaction necessary. Bikeshares are notably a distributed system, thus posing an interesting possibility for research and widespread applicability.
